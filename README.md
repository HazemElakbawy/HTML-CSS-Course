## Review ðŸŒŸ
It was a great journey with jonas throughout this course which i learned alot of things not only writing some code but also how to plan for a project && how to identify its personality thus choosing appropriate design.
What was also great the amout of tools && practical examples provided .
Now it's time for practice , practice , ... .
